Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0: Fast simulation model disabled due to additional core clocks.  High-fidelity simulation model will be used.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0.arch: Periodic OCT re-calibration is disabled because the interface uses calibrated IO standards for either Address, Command or Clock signals.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 2: Component/SODIMM".
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 3 I/O Bank(s) and 3 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0.arch: Valid memory frequencies for the current PLL reference clock and user clock rate, in MHz: 1200.0
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_0.arch: For additional documentation about the interface, consult the *_readme.txt file after generation.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_a10_hps_0: When ECC is enabled, a partial write using the DM pins triggers a read-modify-write operation.  Frequent partial writes can lead to poor efficiency.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_a10_hps_0: Debug features for HPS are currently not supported.
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_a10_hps_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 2: Component/SODIMM".
Info: A10SoM_System.emif_a10_hps_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 2 I/O Bank(s) and 2 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
